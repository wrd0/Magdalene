Lightweight PHP MVC Framework



Magdalene its exactly that, a minimul lightweight MVC Framework 
its provides a clean eviroment for web application development and
its so easy to understand that anyone can modify it to suit their own needs.

    I know currently is not really a framework framework ... but it helps a lot!
	I'll keep adding feautures to it until it gets robust and awesome
